summary: |
  Scalable, pgbench benchmark scenario distributing a workload
  across VMs.

description: |
  <strong>What's this test about?</strong><br/>
  This test allows for the pgbench execution on one or more virtual machines. 
   Many pgbench benchmark parameters can be adjusted, including the scale, clients, 
   jobs and the transactions. VMs will be evenly distributed across the nodes
   in the cluster and pgbench is run in all the VMs using the given parameters.
   In this version we use the "Simple" PGbench mode in which only the select transaction
   types are executed.  By using only the simple transactions and a small workingset
   this workload exercises CPU and memory.
  <br/><br/>
  <strong>How to measure the infrastructure's raw performance?</strong><br/>
  The performance is evaluated by measuring the transactions, throughput and 
  latency of the workload.
  <br/><br/>
  <strong>How is the test run?</strong><br/>
  Setup
  <ol>
    <li>Deploy the desired number of workload VMs per host.</li>
    <li>Run pgbench on each of the VM.</li>
  </ol>
  Measurement
  <ol>
    <li>Run the desired database transactions per pgbench client.</li>
  </ol>
